# Random Tables

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), adding support for random tables.

Turn a table, list, or paragraph with embedded alternatives into a random generator by prefixing a keyword.  Designed for tabletop RPGs and other creative uses.  Supports custom weights, or defaults such as first results being most common. Nested generators are supported. Re-roll results or parts of them, and save in the same document or a new one.
